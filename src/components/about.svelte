            Hi, I'm Hai-Ling! I'm going into my last year of Computer Engineering at Queen's University.
            <br>
            As part of the Queen's co-op program, I've just recently completed a 16-month internship at Defence Research and Development Canada, doing SWE/ML work in the field of network cyber-operations (there's a paper coming soon!). Previously, I worked in offices at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories for both Front-End and Automation internships.
            <br>
            With a broad range experiences in development, I'm hoping to continue to expand my skillset and knowledge with unique and challenging opportunitie
        </p>
            Set to graduate either Spring or Fall 2023 - Looking for internship or full-time opportunities!
