                    <p>
                        Assisted in designing a cyber attack/defense emulated
                        environment (named CyGIL) using OpenAI gym and virtual
                        machines, as a part of Canada’s contribution to TTCP’s CAGE:
                        Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Designed and developed custom command-line attack/defense
                        abilities to be used by RL algorithms
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Worked on interfacing between RL agent and environment
                        through VMware’s REST API

                    <p>
                        Developed the state machine for CyGIL’s simulated
                        environment engine using a data-centric approach derived
                        from the emulated environment’s state spaces
